# Code Refactor Challenge Project

## Description

The major objective of this project is to refactor the code provided to ensure the website meets Search Engine Optimization and Accessibility Standards. I employed the use of Semantic HTML elements to ensure that the website is easily picked up by search engines such as Google. Embarking on this project has helped me to understand and appreciate the basic concepts of HTML and CSS, especially the significance and benefits of Semantic HTML elements. I also learnt how to use Descendant selectors in CSS.
